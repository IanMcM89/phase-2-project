## Usage

A user can create a new user profile by clicking <strong>Create an Account</strong> on the login page, which will redirect the user to the registration page:

    alt="MGBB Registration Page"
    width=75% align=center
/>

After successful account creation, the user will be redirected to the login page where the new credentials can be used to access their user's profile by clicking the <strong>Sign In</strong> button:

    width=75% align=center
/>

The home page, or user profile page, consists of information cards for a variety of plants. Details include recommended sunlight exposure levels, for example, partial to full sun is equal to roughly four to five ‚òÄÔ∏è icons on the scale. The more ‚òÄÔ∏è icons (up to five), the more sun exposure the plant requires. The same can be said for the water, the more üíß icons, the more frequent watering the plant requires. Figure a single üíß icon is roughly once a week. The seasons icons represent the best seasons in which the plant should be cultivated. Some plants can be planted in all seasons, but these icons are the recommended seasons for best results and/or best harvesting once the plant is mature in the case of a vegetable. Seasons are intuitive (üå± = Spring, üèùÔ∏è = Summer, üçÇ = Fall and ‚ùÑÔ∏è = Winter). Each plant card also has a short description and an image for reference.

Users can add plant cards to their favorites tab by clicking the ‚≠ê icon on the plant card. All favorited plants will be added to the favorites tab for quick reference in the future. To remove a plant from a user's favorites, simply cick the ‚≠ê icon again:
